# Coinbase Landing Page Clone

This repository contains a clone of Coinbase's landing page, developed by Luis Álvarez (lalvarezweb) as the final project of an HTML and CSS course at Open Bootcamp, taught by Professor Gorka Villar. The page design was created in Figma and is fully responsive, with 7 sections including a navigation bar, features, benefits, KPIs, onboarding, and a footer with a call to action. All images used in the landing page were sourced from the design in Figma.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Sass

## Usage

To view the landing page, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. The page should render correctly, with all styles and images loading properly.
